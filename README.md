## Hello, friends from far and near. 

![Banner](./banner.png)

I'm David.

I live where data, models, and meaning meet. By day, I explore statistical modeling, optimization, and data science (with a soft spot for open source and healthcare). By night, I write poetry, essays, and ideas that live somewhere between faith and imagination.

This GitHub is my workbench: experiments, code that actually runs, research notes, books, and the occasional side quest. If you’re into stats, data science, curious questions, storytelling and thoughtful problem-solving, you’re in the right place.

Always learning. Occasionally overthinking. Constantly building.
